# ASPIRED-example
Example reduction with ASPIRED

## Use cases

### Spectrum - full reduction
1. [x] Dataset with science and standard field-flattened images and the respective arc image.

### Spectrum - ADU spectrum extraction only (No flux calibration)
2. [x] Dataset with science field-flattened image and the arc image only.

### Spectrum - wavelength calibration only (Pre wavelength-calibrated)
3. [x] Dataset with science and standard field-flattened images only.

### Spectrum - other cases for full or partial reduction
4. [x] User supplied trace(s) for light spectrum extraction (only to extract ADU/s of the spectra).
5. [x] User supplied trace(s) for arc extraction (only to get wavelength calibration polynomial).
6. [x] User supplied wavelength calibration polynomial coefficients.
7. [x] User supplied line list.
8. [x] User supplied pixel-to-wavelength mapping (not fitted).
9. [x] User supplied sensitivity curve.
10. [x] Flux calibration for user supplied wavelength calibrated science and standard 1D spectra.
